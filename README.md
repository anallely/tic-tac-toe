## Scope of Functionalities

* The game works around a series of rounds of tic-tac-toe games between two players graphically displayed in a command-line terminal. Players insert numbers with the keyboard to choose in which of the 9 squares of the board they place a X or a 0. Player who manage two allign 3 equal symbols in a simple vertical/horizontal/diagonal line wins the round.

* Players place their names at the beggining of the game and are refered as such during the entire expirience. When a round is finished, they are invited to either play again with same names or change them.

* While players remain playing with the same names, the amount of games played and games won by each player is tracked and displayed on the screen at the end of the round. When players decide to change names, those numbers are reset.
